This project is done to sprint the interaction between students and teachers for their bachelor's theses, project related work, and other academic purposes. Students can see their upcoming program dates and the committee that was created for their thesis/project related purpose. They can upload the file of their reports to the teachers, and teachers can also evaluate the studentâ€™s progress based on their presentation and report.
